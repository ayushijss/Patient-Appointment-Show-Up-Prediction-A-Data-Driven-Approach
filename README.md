# Patient Appointment Show-Up Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach...



## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will show up for their scheduled medical appointment based on various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, and appointment details.
This can help healthcare providers reduce the number of missed appointments, optimize scheduling, and improve overall patient care and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information from over 107,000 patient appointments and includes 15 columns, with the target variable being showed_up (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes). The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features related to patients and their appointments.

## Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
